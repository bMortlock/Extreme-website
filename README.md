# Extreme-website

When it came to making th Mobile view of the website, I decided to remove the about us and the who we are section as I felt they were not really needed as all of the other sections are related to selling also the who we are and about us sections just based on what 
I can assume is the content of these two sectionsseem very similar. Also The about section seems to be on a sperate page based on the Quick links section as one of the links is simply cvalled about.

If I had more tie I would fix the navigation bar in the mobile view as the navbar is not lined up correctly and seems to break when closed, this is most likely due to the fact that I added that feature near the end insrtead of starting with it so I had to edit aready existing code.
The Website is all reactive however it was buils with 1440px and 425px in mind as they were the largest choices for both laptops and Mobiles in the developer view of my browser.

If I had more time I would have fixed the code to make it fully responsive and make it look good on most of the resolutions includiing bigger screens, I would have also made another page for the about us section and added basic pages for the links to go to.
